Things left to do
-----------------

- Better list view for current events.

- Allow exporting to CSV and sending across the network.

- Nice widget to visualize recent events that happen in a nice way: 
  + Should support zoom and pinch in / out
  + Should also support moving ends of events
  + Should group common sets of events.

- Should include an alert manager on the phone to allow setting the
  current event.
  + Sort of annoying, so allow the user to stop this kind of thing
  from happening.

- Should also include the java mail API to allow the stuff being
  synced at a regular interval.
